# Lab 6
In this lab, you will complete more tree functions.  Again, you must implement the following functions inside main.cpp:

## void getHeight()
Returns the height of the tree.  We did this a few labs ago so it should be easy!

## isAvl()
This function returns true when the supplied binary search tree is AVL compliant

## rotateLeft()
This function performs a left rotation on the supplied tree and returns the newly rotated root

## levelOrderTraversal()
This function performs a level-order traversal of the supplied tree.  Note that a level
order traversal is performed with a queue and _is not_ a recursive function.  

## isComplete()
This function returns true if the supplied binary search tree is complete.
